# aoc2020

This repo contains my implementations of the Advent of Code 2020 challenge, using the Rust programming language.
To me, this is intended as a learning experience to take a dive into Rust. Anyone interested and especially those that also take part
in the Advent of Code are free to check out my code for inspiration.
